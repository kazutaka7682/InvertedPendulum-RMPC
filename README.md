# InvertedPendulum-RMPC
In this repository, "Robust Model Predictive Control (RMPC)" is employed for the inverted pendulum model to perform control simulations.

In addition, we are investigating the use of inline specifications to speed up the simulation of control simulations that require computation time, such as RMPC.

The standard inverted pendulum was modeled using the Lagrangian method.

The gains for the RMPC are fixed, rather than scheduled each time when determining the control input.
